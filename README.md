# Anime

A modern Flutter project built with **Clean Architecture** principles and designed for seamless backend integration.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability. The main layers are:

- **Presentation Layer:** UI and state management.
- **Domain Layer:** Business logic, use cases, and entities.
- **Data Layer:** Data sources, repositories, and models.

Each layer is decoupled, making the codebase easy to extend and refactor.
